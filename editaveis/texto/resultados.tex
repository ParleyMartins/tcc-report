The project has been successful so far, with the website being developed while the script was being made. This already creates a graphical installer, that will run in most linux distributions, for all the cataloged games developed with SDL 1.

The website as of now presents the user with the option to upload a game, with its respective information, like supported platform, related media, and installers.

\section[Future Work]{Future Work}

For the next months it is expected to have the script for the SDL 2 projects finished with support for Windows and MacOS.

Another goal is to have the website running the script automatically when a user links their GitHub repository to the system.
