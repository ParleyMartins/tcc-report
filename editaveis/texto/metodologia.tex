This section explains what was and will be done within the duration of the whole
project. It has the main goal of creating a platform with all the games developed
in the univerity's courses (related to games). The games that will be available must have all their
assets and required libraries packed in order to run in linux distributions without the need
of intalling any other package; they also must have a graphical installer for users
without technical knowledge.

The first step to achieve this goal was to catalogue the games that were made in
this Faculty, thoughout the past semesters. Professor Edson Costa and Mr. Faria were
responsbile for this task. There were 20 games since the spring term of 2012,
when the course 'Introduction to Electronic Games' was created. From these twenty,
16 had their sources still available and were already cloned to the 'fgagamedev'
GitHub organization. However, from these sixteen, only eight had licenses that
allowed us to change their code. Matheus and I were responsible for gather the other
licenses with the original authors of the games while Prof. Edson would work on
the packaging process for one of the licensed games.
