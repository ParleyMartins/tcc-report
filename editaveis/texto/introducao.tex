Games are known to provide several benefits to the players. It may be enjoying a good story, developing new abilities and skills, bonding with friends or just relaxing after a big rushed day. Independent game developers have to struggle to achieve any of these goals, because it's so much harder for people to see their games.

There are some courses taught here in the \textit{Universidade de Bras\'ilia} that have the goal to teach students to develop games. The students that take these have the opportunity to learn how to create a game from scratch. Several of these students wish to continue working on game development after their graduation.

The games developed in those courses usually have a good story and are good to play with, however they are never seen outside the courses because there's nowhere to put them after they are done. People also have the tendency to relate things that are done inside the classes to things that have no use in \textit{real life}, therefore expandable.

This project was created to give visibility to these games and developers and to show the work that has and will be done in this University concerning game development.

\begin{itemize}
\item create an on-line platform to host the games developed in the courses of this University;
