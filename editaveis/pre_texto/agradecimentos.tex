First of all, thank you to my dear family! I couldn't have reached this far without you! My mom, Gl\'aucia Maria Pacheco Terra, and my dad, Paulo Orlando Martins, whom have loved me since my birth and taught me how to be a better person and fight difficulties in life. To my brother Sam Pacheco Martins and sister \'Elida Pacheco Martins, whom I love so much, despite all the worries they give me. To my extended family, uncles, aunts, cousins, that are so many to name each, but have seen my potential even when I couldn't see it.Thank you sou much! Your faith in me makes me go further than I ever thought I could!

I also want to thank with all the warmth of my heart the friends who have been with me in this journey and helped me through this stressful period of life, either here in Brazil or in my dear Canada. Huge thanks to one of my favorite people in the world Mateus Medeiros Furquim Mendon\c{c}a and his entire family, Elis, Geovane and Tiago, for helping me keeping my sanity with all the laughs and games, and also for giving me a place to study. I couldn't have done half of this work if you hadn't welcomed and sheltered me this semester. I love you all!

Special thanks to my supervisor, Professor Edson Alves da Costa Junior, who saw potential on a 16 years old boy and never stopped believing in me ever since. Thanks for guiding me through this work.
