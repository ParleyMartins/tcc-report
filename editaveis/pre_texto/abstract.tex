\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
   Games developed in the University don't have much recognition or support. End users usually never get to play or say anything about any version of any of them, either good or bad ones. Most people don't even know that games are created in classes. This project aims to make these games available to people, because the work made in a university, especially a public one, should be accessible to everyone and because these games were made with the purpose of learning and providing fun to the users. This document outlines how this work will be achieved, by creating a platform to upload the created games.
