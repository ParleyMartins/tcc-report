\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
Games developed in the University don't have much recognition or support. Users don't usually get to play them or give a feedback about any version of any of them, either good, bad or bug reports. Most people don't even know that games are created in classes. This project aims to make these games available to people, by developing an on-line platform. Everything created in the university, especially a public one, should be accessible to the society, since its conception to its implementation. Because of that, this document outlines how this work will be achieved, by creating a platform to upload the developed games. It will also provide the building of packages to simplify the installation process for the user.
